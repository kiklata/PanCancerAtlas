Experiment Description	Metastatic uveal melanoma generally responds poorly to immunotherapy. The aim here was to sequence tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from uveal melanoma metastases to study their phenotypes and T-cell receptor (TCR) clonotypes. We performed paired single-cell transcriptome and TCR sequencing using the 10x Genomics platform of IL2-expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes from 7 liver and 1 subcutaneous metastasis.

Protocol Description	Gene expression libraries were run on a NextSeq instrument (Illumina).	V(D)J libraries were sequenced on a MiSeq instrument (Illumina).	Cells were counted and 7 000 cells were injected into a single cell library preparation instrument (10x Genomics). Single cells were isolated into barcoded gel beads-in-emulsion (GEMs) using Chromium microfluidic chips (Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit, PN: 1000009, 10x Genomics), after which barcodes and sample index sequences were ligated to transcripts. Barcoded first-strand cDNA were then purified using magnetic beads and amplified with PCR.	5' expression libraries were generated, according to the kit descriptions provided by 10x Genomics, from amplified cDNA using the following kits: Chromium Single Cell 3'/5' Library Construction Kit (PN: 1000020, 10x Genomics), Chromium Single Cell 5' Library & Gel Bead Kit (PN: 1000006), Chromium Single Cell A Chip Kit (PN: 1000009, 10x Genomics) and Chromium i7 Multiplex Kit (PN: 120262, 10x Genomics)	V(D)J segments were enriched, according to the kit descriptions provided by 10x Genomics, from amplified cDNA using Chromium Single Cell V(D)J Enrichment Kit, Human T Cell (PN: 1000005, 10x Genomics) and sequencing adapters ligated.	Small pieces of tumor biopsies were cultured for two weeks in TIL medium (RPMI1640 containing 10% human serum and 6000 U/ml IL-2). Young TIL (yTIL) cultures were then cryopreserved before use. Two days before performing the single cell experiments, yTIL cultures were thawed and cultured in TIL medium containing 600 U IL-2.
